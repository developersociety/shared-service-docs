It reiterates that your strategy helps you to identify what already exists, what should be created and, more importantly, why it should be created.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brain Traffic has created the <a href=\"http://blog.braintraffic.com/2012/07/from-the-archive-brain-traffic-lands-the-quad/\">Content Strategy Quad ©</a> &nbsp;to help describe the content-oriented and people-oriented components you need to know.&nbsp;We have adapted it a bit to discuss the components that come together to help you create a successful strategy and governance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Content Lifecycle</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Producing compelling and sustainable content means that you need to understand and follow the content lifecycle.&nbsp; Erin Scime identifies that there are five stages in the lifecycle.&nbsp; In general, content lifecycles include the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Audit and Analysis</strong>:&nbsp; Content stakeholder&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/individual-interviews.html\">interviews</a>, competitive analysis, objective analysis and evaluation of the content environment (site, partner content, sister, parent sites)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Strategy</strong>: Determine topical ownership areas, taxonomy, process/ workflow for content production, sourcing plan, voice and brand definition</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Plan</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/project-team.html\">Staffing recommendations</a>, content management system customization, metadata plan, communications plan, migration plan</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Create</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/individual-interviews.html\">Writing content</a>, asset production, governance model, search engine optimization, quality assurance</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Maintain</strong>: Plan for periodic auditing, advise the client, determine targets for success measures.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Several of the deliverables related to each of those phases overlap with the deliverables of other fields, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/information-architecture.html\">information architecture</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-research.html\">user research</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/project-management.html\">project management</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/web-analytics.html\">web analytics</a>.&nbsp; Instead of thinking of who owns each deliverable, it’s important to think of who contributes to each and how those different contributions come together to define the final product.&nbsp; There’s value in including multiple perspectives on deliverables.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Best Practices for Creating Meaningful Content</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We have identified these best practices to help you create meaningful and relevant content.&nbsp; Each piece of content should:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Reflect your organization’s goals and user’s needs</strong>.&nbsp; You can discover your user’s needs through conducting market research,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-research.html\">user research</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/web-analytics.html\">analyzing web metrics</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Understand how user’s think and speak about a subject.&nbsp;</strong>Content should then be created and structured based on that.&nbsp; Doing this will also help you with search engine optimization (SEO).</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Communicate to people in a way that they understand</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/writing-for-the-web.html\">Embracing plain writing principles</a>&nbsp;helps with this.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Be useful</strong>.&nbsp; By being purposeful in the content that you include, omit the needless.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Stay up-to-date and and remain factual.</strong>&nbsp; When new information becomes available, update your content or archive it.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/accessibility.html\">accessible</a>&nbsp;to all people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>You have a responsibility to make sure that all people can access and benefit from your information.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Be consistent.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Following style guides, both for language and design, helps people understand and learn what you are trying to communicate.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Be able to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Make sure that users can find your content both through internally through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/information-architecture.html\">navigation</a>&nbsp;and also externally through search engines.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Help define the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/requirements.html\">requirements</a>&nbsp;for the overall site.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Content should drive design, structure, etc</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>References</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://alistapart.com/article/thedisciplineofcontentstrategy\">The Discipline of Content Strategy</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;by Kristina Halvorson</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://uxmag.com/articles/content-strategy-and-ux-a-modern-love-story\">Content Strategy and UX: A Modern Love Story</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;by Kristina Halverson</li>\r\n\t<li><em>Content Strategy for the Web</em>&nbsp;by Kristina Halvorson</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://blog.braintraffic.com/2012/07/from-the-archive-brain-traffic-lands-the-quad/\">Content Strategy Quad ©</a> by Brain Traffic</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://contentini.com/content-strategists-what-do-they-do/\">Content Strategists: What Do They Do</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;by Dan Zambonini</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://boxesandarrows.com/content-strategy-the-philosophy-of-data/\">Content Strategy: The Philosophy of Data</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;by Rachel Lovinger</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://alistapart.com/article/a-checklist-for-content-work\">The Elements of Content Strategy</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(excerpt) by Erin Kissane.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"
