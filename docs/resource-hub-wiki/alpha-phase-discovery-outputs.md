For the alpha phase we created a [Theory of change triangle](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lUfTAEo=/) to align on high level aims and objectives, outcomes and activities to get us there. 

## Personas

A number of user personas were generated to help generate empathy with the potential end users..
