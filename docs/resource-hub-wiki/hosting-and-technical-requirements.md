The Catalyst Resource Hub is built on Drupal 9, so hosting, support and maintenance requirements follow Drupal's requirements. 

## Overview

To get started, we recommend a hosting environment with at least:

 - 2GB RAM
 - PHP 7.3+
 - MySQL 5.7.8+ / MariaDB  10.3.7+ 

## Hosting requirements.

To deploy the system to a hosted environment, you will need a a hosting environment with a web server, PHP and a database. 

## PHP and Database 

- Drupal 9 requires at least PHP 7.3. PHP 7.4
- Drupal 9 with MySQL or Percona, version 5.7.8+ is required.
- Drupal 9 with MariaDB, version 10.3.7+ is required.

See [Environment requirements of Drupal 9
](https://www.drupal.org/docs/understanding-drupal/how-drupal-9-was-made-and-what-is-included/environment-requirements-of)

## Recommended server specification

For light usage, a server with 2 GB RAM is probably sufficient.


## Security updates and maintenance

It is important to keep your site up to date with security updates from Drupal core. All professional open source projects release security updates regularly and Drupal releases bug fixes on the first Wednesday of each month and security updates on the third Wednesday of each month. See https://www.drupal.org/about/core/policies/core-release-cycles/schedule

This is usually a job for a developer who is familiar with Drupal, composer and transferring files to a hosting environment. For small site, this could start at about 1 hour of developer time per month, but this will depend on the developer.
