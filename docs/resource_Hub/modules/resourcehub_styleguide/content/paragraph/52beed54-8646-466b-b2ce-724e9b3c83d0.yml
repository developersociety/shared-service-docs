      value: "<p>Video isn't just about pictures,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>it's also about sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without the audio you would have to guess what this film is about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frustrating, isn't it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not knowing what's going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That's the situation for everyone who can't hear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Captions make videos accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is also handy for people who want to watch video in loud environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or where you need to be very, very quiet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There's something about great design</p>\r\n\r\n<p>that allows it to go practically unnoticed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it doesn't take much to make things confusing and frustrating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing colors with poor contrast makes navigating, reading, and interacting a real pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good design means sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That's not just text and images but links, icons, and buttons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it's important enough to be seen, then it needs to be clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this is essential for people with low contrast sensitivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which becomes more common as we age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With good colors, websites and applications</p>\r\n\r\n<p>can be easier to use in more situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like in different lighting conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine if you could only communicate with your family by writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes it's just easier to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the advances of technology is voice recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it's searching the Web:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Nineteenth Century Architecture.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dictating emails:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Send email to Jack Harding.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or controlling your navigation app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people with physical disabilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>rely on voice recognition to use the computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Place order.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for that to happen websites and apps need to be properly coded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Go? Cancel?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voice recognition could help lots of other people</p>\r\n\r\n<p>with temporary limitations too, like an injured arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Place order.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can also prevent injuries becoming worse,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>like RSI: Repetitive Stress Injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or for people simply preferring voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Some people can't see the text on this screen.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Fortunately, computers can convert text to speech.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's technology that many people who are blind have been relying on for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it's also important for many people with dyslexia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And very useful for people who have difficulty reading text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as some people who just like to multi-task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for this to work,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>websites and apps have to be properly coded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which has the added benefit of helping search engines index websites' contents better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poor layout can be very frustrating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the same applies to the Web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good design involves good layout</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and that means a better user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This includes clear headings, navigation bars, and consistent styling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any web user will get frustrated with bad layout and design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complex layouts also make finding information difficult</p>\r\n\r\n<p>or impossible for people with visual disabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And they are confusing for people with cognitive and learning disabilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>who need clarity and consistency of the presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bad design also impacts anyone who isn't particularly confident around computers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the right gears can be put in motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hands can be at the exact place they need to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you don't get the response that you're expecting,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>you'll end up wondering if there's some sort of problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's the same on the Web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without clear notifications and feedback,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>people are quickly disorientated and confused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Especially error messages which are often complex and confusing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet making the understandable is usually quite simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making websites and apps predictable and understandable</p>\r\n\r\n<p>makes them accessible to people with cognitive and learning disabilities,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and more usable for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Especially for people with lower computer skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trying to hit a small target requires lots of effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many websites and applications try to thread the needle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on the Web, we can make areas for clicking and tapping larger and easier to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is handy on mobile devices</p>\r\n\r\n<p>especially when we might be moving around at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is critical for people with reduced dexterity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What's right for you</p>\r\n\r\n<p>doesn't necessarily work for the next person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Customization isn't always just a question of preference though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, it's a necessity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being able to adjust the text is crucial with low vision and dyslexia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Properly coded websites and applications allow the text to be customized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, to change its size, spacing, font, and colors</p>\r\n\r\n<p>without loss of functions or clarity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"To postulate a conceit more irksome</p>\r\n\r\n<p>than being addressed in sesquipedalian syntax is adamantine\",</p>\r\n\r\n<p>it is better to say:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Being spoken to in unnecessarily long</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and complicated language is a pain\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet many websites lack structuring</p>\r\n\r\n<p>using headings, lists, and separations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or they use overly complex language, jargon,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and unexplained acronyms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It makes them difficult and unappealing for many people,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>including non-native speakers,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and makes them unusable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not being able to use your computer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>because you mouse doesn't work, is frustrating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people use only the keyboard to navigate websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either through preference or circumstance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it's temporarily limited mobility,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a permanent physical disability,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>or simply a broken mouse,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>the result is the same:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Websites and apps need to be operable by keyboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.</p>\r\n"
